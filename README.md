# VDS-Configuration-Editor

Efficiently edit and extend Vault Data Standard Configurations using this Visual Studio Solution.
Starting with 2025 releases, the editor solution requires two different projects:
- a .NET Core targeting project to edit CAD configuration files.
- a .NET Framework targeting project to edit the Vault configuration files.
